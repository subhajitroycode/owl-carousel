# Owl Carousel

## Description: 
This is small project that I made to learn how to use Owl Carousel. The design was inspired by [CodingLab's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKKcGb80MOs) tutorial. 

Also this is the first time I used any JavaScript library to create a carousel and it's [swiperjs](https://www.swiperjs.com) library.
